Schola Cantorum presented _**Sacred Spaces**_, 
a concert of music from some of the world&rsquo;s great religious traditions and great composers, 
at **Mission Santa Clara** on **March 18**. It was a wonderful experience for the
performers and the audience alike. Schola thanks our supporters, our audience, and our volunteers, and gives special
thanks to Kyle and Susan Ridout for sponsoring this concert in memory of Royal Stanton, the founder of Schola Cantorum.

_For the safety of our audience and our members, attendees will be required to show proof of vaccination and wear masks while in the building._
