Morton Lauridsen&rsquo;s _Lux Aeterna_ seamlessly integrates ancient modes, Renaissance polyphony,
Romanticism, and modern harmonies, connecting the listener to his or her own mortal journey.

Artistic Director Buddy James and members of Schola Cantorum will also perform this work
in Carnegie Hall on April 23, 2023.
