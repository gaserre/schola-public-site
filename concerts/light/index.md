Morten Lauridsen&rsquo;s _Lux Aeterna_ seamlessly integrates ancient modes, Renaissance polyphony,
Romanticism, and modern harmonies, connecting the listener to his or her own mortal journey.

in **Carnegie Hall** on April 23, 2023. If you&rsquo;re a singer and would like to join Schola
for this opportunity, please <a href="/sing">check out our Auditions page!</a>
