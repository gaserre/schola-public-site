Leonardo da Vinci&rsquo;s brilliance is brought to life through his words and drawings. 
Using cutting-edge technology, Schola synchronizes dramatic choral and orchestral music 
with stunning visuals of Leonardo&rsquo;s notebooks
for an unforgettable multimedia experience.

Leonardo himself, whose genius encompassed both science and art, 
would be proud of this combination of technology and music!
