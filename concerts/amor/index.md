A concert featuring the musical splendor of Mexico and Argentina!
Two joyful compositions, Juan Gutierrez de Padilla&rsquo;s 17th-century double chorus masterpiece
_Missa Ego Flos Campi_ and Ariel Ramirez&rsquo;s famous folk mass
_Misa Criolla_, will be performed alongside selections from Carlos Guastavino&rsquo;s
sparkling _Indianas_, folk and popular song arrangements from Mexico and, of course, a Tango!
