Leonard Bernstein&rsquo;s beloved choral classic _Chichester Psalms_, with organ, harp, percussion, and boy soprano,
will be performed alongside the premier complete performance of the organ and harp version of Shawn Kirchner&rsquo;s
melodious and inspiring _Songs of Ascent_. This concert of Psalm settings will take listeners on an emotional journey
as relevant today as the day the Psalms were written, with both works concluding with text from Psalm 133,
&ldquo;Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.&rdquo;
