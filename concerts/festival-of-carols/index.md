We raised our voices *together* once again this holiday season in a program of beloved carols and holiday tunes, featuring 
Ralph Vaughan Williams&rsquo;s *Fantasia on Christmas Carols* as well as works by Benjamin Britten and Andr&eacute; Thomas, and classics such as the *Carol of the Drum* and the *Carol of the Bells*.

This concert took place *live* on Sunday, December 12, at St. Joseph of Cupertino Catholic Church.
Schola especially wants to thank Candy Pelissero and Brian Larsen for sponsoring this concert!
