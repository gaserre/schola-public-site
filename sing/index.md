# Sing with Schola Cantorum!

Historic **Schola Cantorum Silicon Valley** welcomes new singers for its 58th season, &ldquo;There will be Songs!&rdquo; We are currently enjoying a live and in-person season.

<h2>Auditions</h2>
<p>Interested singers are invited to join Schola Cantorum for the first rehearsal for the third concert of the season, <b><i>Sacred Spaces</i></b>, at <b>7:15 PM</b> on <b>Monday, January 10, 2022</b> at <a href="https://www.laumc.org" target="_blank">Los Altos United Methodist Church</a>. Singers will have the opportunity to meet members of the choir and experience the joy and energy of Schola Cantorum. Singers who are interested in joining will then be invited to schedule a one-on-one audition with the Artistic Director. <b>Please bring a mask and proof that you&rsquo;re fully vaccinated (including booster shots if applicable)!</b></p>

<p>Individual auditions include scales, pitch-matching, sight-reading exercises, and a one-minute unaccompanied excerpt of a song. An aria, art song, folksong, or musical theater selection is preferred and it does not need to be memorized.</p>

<p>Singers will be notified of the outcome of their auditions prior to the second rehearsal. If your audition was successful, you&rsquo;ll then be asked to fill out some paperwork. That&rsquo;s it!</p>

<h2>Frequently-Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<ol type="1">
  <li><b>What precautions are being taken to addresss risks related to COVID-19?</b>
  <p>Schola Cantorum is very concerned about the welfare of its members and its audience. We are following all local, state, and federal guidelines regarding singing and performing and are prepared to adapt quickly to any changes in order to ensure the safety of all involved. At the present time, Schola Cantorum requires that all its members and prospective members be fully vaccinated, wear a singer’s mask during in-person rehearsals, and practice social distancing (for example, we will only sit in every other row, leaving empty rows between singers). We are also limiting rehearsals to two sessions of approximately one hour each, separated by a 20-minute break to air out the sanctuary.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>AUDITIONS</h3>
  <ol type="1" start="2">
  <li><b>What kind of person sings in Schola Cantorum?</b>
 <p>Schola Cantorum aspires to be as diverse as Silicon Valley. Members include music professionals, business and tech professionals, artists, entrepreneurs, retired individuals, college students, and many more. Schola Cantorum is a supportive and inclusive ensemble that welcomes people of all ages, ethnicities, orientations, and backgrounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>I get really nervous at auditions. Will this be a problem?</b>
    <p>We strive to make everyone feel comfortable and supported. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7l6XKY8YyI" target="_blank">Here is a short video</a> where our Artistic Director, Buddy James, discusses the audition process.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>I do not read music well. Should I still audition?</b>
    <p>Schola Cantorum singers come with diverse experiences and backgrounds. Many have beautiful voices yet struggle to read music. Schola Cantorum provides support in the form of recordings and MIDI tracks to help singers learn their music and their pronunciations outside of rehearsal. All Schola Cantorum singers either sing with a pleasant voice or read music well, and most do both.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>I have never studied voice privately. Should I still audition?</b>
    <p>Schola Cantorum singers come with diverse experiences and backgrounds. Many read music yet do not have strong solo voices. Through diligent vocal warm-ups and guidance in rehearsals, Schola members become better, stronger, and more confident singers.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>I have not sung in a choir for many years. Should I still audition?</b>
    <p>Singing in a choir is like riding a horse. It's time to get back on!</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>SINGER EXPECTATIONS</h3>
  <ol type="1" start="7">
  <li><b>When and where are rehearsals?</b>
    <p>Regular rehearsals are on Monday evenings, from 7:15 to approximately 9:30 with a 20-minute break, at the <a href="https://laumc.org" target="_blank">Los Altos United Methodist Church</a>. There will also be one or two additional rehearsals during the week immediately preceding a concert, which will be announced as the concert approaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>How many performances are there each season?</b>
    <p>Schola performs four full concerts each year and gives one or two performances of each concert. Typically we sing a concert at the end of October/beginning of November, a Holiday concert in mid-December, a concert at the beginning of March, and a final concert towards the end of May.</p>
    <p>In addition to our performances, singers are invited to join us for our annual Messiah Sing, the longest-running Messiah Sing in the Bay Area; our Summer Sings and weekend sing-alongs; and Outreach concerts for schools and civic events.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Where does Schola Cantorum perform?</b>
    <p>Performances occur throughout Silicon Valley, with occasional performances in other nearby communities in the Bay Area.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>How much does it cost to sing in Schola Cantorum?</b>
    <p>Singers are encouraged to donate $350 to Schola Cantorum for the year, or $600 for couples. We strive to receive donations from 100% of our membership, but no singer is ever turned away for lack of funds.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What are the attendance expectations for singers?</b>
    <p>We strive for perfect attendance! Singers are expected to attend all rehearsals and all performances for the year. If illness or conflicts make attendance impossible, singers are asked to inform their Section Leader as soon as possible. Any singer who misses more than two rehearsals for any given concert, or misses any dress rehearsal, will be asked to attend a singing session with the Artistic Director and their Section Leader to demonstrate that they are adequately prepared musically. Singers who are not prepared at this session will be asked to sit out the concert, but will be invited to return for the next concert.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Will I need to re-audition?</b>
    <p>All singers will be asked to sing privately for the Artistic Director on a rotating basis after 1, 2, or 3 years. Former Schola members who have not met the attendance requirements discussed above, or who have not sung in two consecutive concerts sets, will need to re-audition before returning to Schola.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>What do we wear when we perform?</b>
  <p>The standard performing attire is a tuxedo with a pleated shirt and a wing collar, or a specific dress selected by Schola's Wardrobe Committee. Singers are expected to purchase their own concert attire, but again, no singer is ever turned away for lack of funds.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Are there other opportunities to make music, such as small groups, solos, and so forth?</b>
    <p>We often perform Outreach concerts (caroling, singing in schools, etc.) where singers are able to sing in small groups or ensembles. In addition, the Artistic Director may from time to time offer solo opportunities to members of the chorus.</p>
  </li>
