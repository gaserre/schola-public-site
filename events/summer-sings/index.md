The Schola Cantorum Summer Sings are remarkable events where lovers of choral music gather to sing through the great masterworks. 
Members of Schola Cantorum sing side by side with members of other Bay Area choruses and with people who don&rsquo;t have time to sing with a regular chorus. 
We were proud to continue this tradition this summer, especially after the pandemic made singing together nearly impossible during the past two summers.
**Thank you** to all who made the music possible this summer: the singers, the pianists, the conductors, 
and all of the wonderful members and staff of Schola Cantorum.

We look forward to seeing you all at our annual Messiah Sing in December and next summer as we revisit the great works at our Summer Sings 2023.

_Dr. Buddy James<br>
Artistic Director, Schola Cantorum Silicon Valley_
