**Fill your Monday nights with music and friends!**<br>
 Join us this summer for our annual sing-alongs of beloved choral masterworks.
 You bring the voice; we supply the scores; our accompanist Dawn Reyen provides
 the 10-fingered orchestra; and a variety of local conductors stitch it all
 together.
