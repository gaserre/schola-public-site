There’s always been something intoxicating about New Orleans.

There, you&rsquo;ll find style and elegance brought by the Acadian French who, in the 1700s, escaped the British invaders and made their way down the Mississippi. They settled in the bayous surrounding New Orleans. Known as _Cajuns_, they developed an emotional, boistrous style of music in their new homeland. The combination of African, Spanish and Native Americans contributed spicy cuisine, delightful music and colorful celebrations.

This is how New Orleans became the birthplace of jazz: it&rsquo;s a potpourri of music of the Cajuns and Creoles ... plus the gospel tradition of southern Black musicians. These are the roots of blues and jazz — a _sound unique to America,_ and one that&rsquo;s celebrated all over the world.

Live the dream of New Orleans on this special night of music, friendship and celebration at **_An Evening of Jazz in the Big Easy._** Bring a friend, someone you love, or just your own sweet self, for an evening that surprises and delights as it benefits the 58-year-mission of Schola Cantorum — to bring _the Joy of Singing_ to Silicon Valley.
