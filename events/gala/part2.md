There’s always been something intoxicating about New Orleans.

There, you&rsquo;ll find style and elegance brought by the Acadian French who, in the 1700s, escaped the British invaders and made their way down the Mississippi. They settled in the bayous surrounding New Orleans. Known as _Cajuns_, they developed a boistrous style of music and an exciting cuisine reflecting their new homeland. The combination of African, Spanish, and Native American cultures contributed spicy cuisine, delightful music and colorful celebrations.

This is how New Orleans became the birthplace of jazz: it&rsquo;s a potpourri of music of the Cajuns and Creoles ... plus the gospel tradition of southern Black musicians. These are the roots of blues and jazz — a _sound unique to America,_ and one that&rsquo;s celebrated all over the world.

We&rsquo;re glad to say that Schola&rsquo;s Gala this year was great fun and a great success! Thanks to everyone who came, who donated,
who volunteered, and who contributed in so many ways to an exciting and rewarding event!
