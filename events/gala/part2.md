Do you remember the first time you saw the stars?
Really saw them, with the Milky Way flowing across the sky? 
That feeling you had goes back&mdash;_way_ back. 
Humans have been reaching for the stars ever since we first looked up, yearning for what&rsquo;s just out of reach.

We&rsquo;ve always wanted to know our place in the universe, 
where we and our &ldquo;blue marble&rdquo; came from, and whether we&rsquo;re alone in the cosmos. 
But all of this misses the point: 
while we may look to the skies for practical, scientific, or religious reasons, 
the overwhelming feelings we experience are _awe_ and _wonder_.

We all look at the night sky to wonder at the vastness
of space and gain some perspective. We may no longer look at the Big Dipper and see a bear, 
and we may not perceive Zeus hurling thunderbolts at us, 
but our greatest technological achievements&mdash;humans on the moon, rovers on Mars, 
probes and space telescopes peering ever further&mdash;have only magnified our inner child&rsquo;s primal wonder.

Come experience _wonder_, and help Schola Cantorum _**Reach for the Stars!**_
