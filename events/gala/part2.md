There’s always been something intoxicating about New Orleans.

There’s the tradition of style and elegance based on
the traditions of the French Canadians — *Cajuns* —
who made their way down to New Orleans in the
1700s, and the Spanish who first settled where
the Mississippi met the Caribbean.
But best of all is that indescribable jazz, built
upon the culture of a whole other world — that
of the southern Black musicians who moved their
music from gospel to blues and jazz. A sound
unique to America, and one that’s celebrated
all over the world for its delightful,
sometimes-raucous way of being.

Live the dream of New Orleans on this special
night of music, friendship and celebration at
***An Evening of Jazz in the Big Easy***. Bring a friend,
or someone you love, or just your own sweet self,
for an evening that surprises and delights as it
benefits the 56-year-mission of Schola Cantorum
— to bring the Joy of Singing to the Silicon Valley.
