Schola welcomes singers of all ages and abilities to **Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga**
on **Monday, December 19** at **7:30 pm** for its 56th annual _Messiah_ Sing.

We will sing the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work, with orchestra.
Come join us in a jubilant celebration of the season!

_**Please note:** Schola abides by all legal and venue masking requirements, as well as CDC recommendations.
Because Santa Clara County COVID-19 transmission rates are currently in the &ldquo;high&rdquo; range,
we will require all attendees to wear masks._
