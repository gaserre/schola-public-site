Schola welcomes singers of all ages and abilities to **Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga**
on **Monday, December 19** at **7:30 pm** for its 56th annual _Messiah_ Sing.

We will sing the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work.
Come join us in a jubilant celebration of the season!

_Schola abides by all legal and venue masking requirements, as well as CDC recommendations.
Participants will be required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. As of now, we anticipate that masks will be optional,
but separate areas will be provided for singers who wish to sit away from those who choose not to wear masks._
