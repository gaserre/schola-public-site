Schola welcomed singers of all ages and abilities to **Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga**
on **Sunday, December 19** for its 55th annual _Messiah_ Sing. After waiting so long, it was wonderful to get together to sing this glorious masterwork!

We sang the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work, accompanied by Schola&rsquo;s amazing Dawn Reyen on electronic piano.
For safety, we sang outdoors for the first time. Let&rsquo;s hope we can do it indoors this coming year!
