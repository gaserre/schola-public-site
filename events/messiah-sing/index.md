Schola welcomes singers of all ages and abilities to **Sacred Heart Church in Saratoga**
on **Monday, December 19** at **7:30 pm** for its 56th annual _Messiah_ Sing.

We will sing the Christmas section of _Messiah_, plus other favorite movements from the work, with orchestra.
Come join us in a jubilant celebration of the season!

_**Please note:** All attendees **must** wear masks. This is due to a recent increase in COVID-19 transmission rates in Santa Clara County. Schola abides by all legal and venue masking requirements, as well as CDC recommendations to keep both our members and our audience safe._
