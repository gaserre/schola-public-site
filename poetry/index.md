# 2022&ndash;2023 Poetry Contest

Schola Cantorum offers an opportunity for young local poets to hear their words
put to music by a renowned composer and sung by one of the Bay Area&rsquo;s premier choirs
under the direction of Schola’s artistic director, Buddy
James. The contest is a contemporary venture of artistic collaboration and
community, open to high school students who live or attend school in Santa Clara
County.

* 2022&ndash;2023 Theme: &ldquo;The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars ...&rdquo;
* Prizes are: $500 First Place; $300 Second Place; $200 Third Place. While only
  the First Place poem will be set to music and performed at a live concert, all
  prize winners will be featured in Schola Cantorum&rsquo;s publicity materials and on
  the group&rsquo;s website.
* The contest will be judged by a panel including a local Poet Laureate, 
  Schola Cantorum Directors, and the composer. The
  submission deadline is November 18, 2022. The 10 finalists will be announced
  in January, 2023. The three winning poems will be announced at Schola&rsquo;s
  spring concert on Saturday, May 20. 
  The title of this Schola concert is &ldquo;The Sun, the Moon, and the Stars ... .&rdquo;

   12th grades in the fall of 2022, who live or attend school in Santa Clara
   County, California.
2. There is a maximum of 2 poems per entrant. All poems must be in English, be
   the original work of the author and not have been previously published or won
   another competition at the time of entry. For the purpose of this contest,
   the following definition of &ldquo;published&rdquo; will apply: intentionally distributed
   to the public in any format &ldquo;accepted for publication or broadcast in any
   format including self-publishing for monetary gain.&rdquo; Poems may have been part
   of a school assignment and reviewed by a High School teacher.
3. No entrant may win more than one prize.
4. All poems must have a title and be 20 lines or less (title and spaces between
   stanzas do not count). Any rhyme scheme except free verse is allowed. The
   evaluation of the poems will be partially based upon their ability to be
   adapted into a choral composition.
5. All entries must be submitted online, through
   [this form](https://forms.gle/ipxLLhWzNPtbp9um8). No late entries will be
   accepted. Entries received after the deadline will be disqualified. No postal
   entries are accepted&mdash;sorry. We do hope you can find someone to help you with
   an online entry, or try your school or local library.
6. Each entry must be the entrant&rsquo;s/author&rsquo;s original work. Should an entry be
   found to contain any plagiarized content it will be automatically
   disqualified from the competition, along with any additional work by that
   poet.
7. **The author agrees to grant Schola Cantorum an irrevocable, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license of unlimited duration to publish, perform, display,
   broadcast, reproduce, distribute, transmit, display, and create derivative

   on the Schola Cantorum website, in an anthology and/or in media publications or
   broadcasts.**
8. Schola Cantorum also reserves the right to give entrants&rsquo; contact details to
   the media, if among the winners.

2. Finalists will be notified in January, 2023. The judges&rsquo; decision is
   final and no correspondence will be entered into.
3. The top three winners will be announced at Schola&rsquo;s May concert. The
   first prize winning poem (or an excerpt of the poem) will be used in a choral
   performance at that concert. Prizes will be presented at this event. Prizes
   will be mailed if the winner cannot attend in person.
