Our top priority is assuring that everyone at a Schola event is safe.
We have taken precautions to make sure that Schola members are healthy
and will not infect others. These include:
<ul>
  <li>requiring proof of full vaccinations from all of our members, staff, and volunteers;</li>
<li>requiring all members to show a negative test result done within 72 hours of each performance;</li>
<li>wearing masks while performing indoors;</li>
<li>limiting performances to one hour.</li>
</ul>
<p>We abide by all Federal, State, and local health and safety
requirements and guidelines. We ask that you, our loyal supporters, join us
by showing proof of full vaccination and wearing masks while attending our live
performances. Let's share our love of music, but do it safely.</p>
