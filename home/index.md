Schola&rsquo;s 59th season is a celebration of _**Light, Love, the Moon, and the Stars**_!
Our first concert, _**Â¡Amor!**_, highlighted the beauty of the Latin American musical tradition and the Spanish language.
After a celebration of the music of the holiday season in December, our March concert focus is on **Light**
with Morton Lauridsen&rsquo;s ethereal _Lux Aeterna_, while our May concert explores **the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars**.
Check out the details and buy tickets on our <a href="/concerts/">Concerts page!</a>
