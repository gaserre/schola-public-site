Schola&rsquo;s 59th season was a celebration of _**Light, Love, the Moon, and the Stars**_!
Our first concert, _**Â¡Amor!**_, highlighted the beauty of the Latin American musical tradition and the Spanish language.
After a celebration of the music of the holiday season in December, our March concert focused on **Light**
with Morton Lauridsen&rsquo;s ethereal _Lux Aeterna_, while our May concert explored **the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars**.
