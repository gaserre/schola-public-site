Morten Lauridsen&rsquo;s _Lux Aeterna_ seamlessly integrates ancient modes, Renaissance polyphony,
Romanticism, and modern harmonies, connecting the listener to his or her own mortal journey.

Members of Schola Cantorum, along with singers from other performing groups, will perform this work
in **Carnegie Hall** on April 23, 2023, under the baton of
Artistic Director Buddy James. If you&rsquo;d like to attend
