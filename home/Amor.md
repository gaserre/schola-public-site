A concert of Central and South American musical artistry awaits! This concert of masses and folk songs
includes selections ranging from Padilla&rsquo;s _Missa Ego Flos Campi_ of the 17th century to modern
Latin American folk songs and modern composer Nick Gutierrez&rsquo;s hauntingly beautiful _Amo_.
