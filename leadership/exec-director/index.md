Schola is pleased to welcome Anne Hill as our new Executive Director! Anne spent many years of her professional life in corporate America; however, she thoroughly enjoys working for nonprofits and was the founder of a nonprofit organization that provided support for women and children in underserved communities. She has a deep appreciation for music (of various genres) and in her younger years, she performed in a choir and landed leading roles in musicals. She had a strong interest in performing arts and planned to pursue it professionally, but she eventually decided to pursue a degree in Business Management, which redirected her career path. Her father, a talented multi-instrumentalist and music producer, is her biggest inspiration in life, and she is inspired by his example of courage, strength, perseverance and determination.  She is thrilled to be a part of Schola.
