<p><b>Fill your Monday nights with music and friends!</b><br>
 Join us this summer for our annual sing-alongs of beloved choral masterworks.
 You bring the voice; we supply the scores; our accompanist Dawn Reyen provides
 the 10-fingered orchestra; and a variety of local conductors stitch it all
 together.</p>

 <p>Admission is $20 for each sing, or you can purchase a <b>Flex Pass</b> that
 gives six entries for $100. Use it for one entry to each of the six sings, or
 six entries to one sing, or any mixture. (Students under 25 get free admission
 with ID.)</p>
